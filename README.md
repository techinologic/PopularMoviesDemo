### Design Recipe
STEPS:	YOUR RESPONSES	REFLECTIONS	REFLECTION NOTES
STEP ONE: 	Understand the problem.  Ask questions, if needed.	Easy (A piece of cake)	What caused you to feel the reflection you just selected? Enter details of your reflection of this step here.
Document any points of confusion or questions you may have ===>>>	The design recipe part. Some parts do not apply to the challenge.	Eesy	
			
STEP TWO:	Determine the names of the program, class, method, or function.	Easy (A piece of cake)	What caused you to feel the reflection you just selected? Enter details of your reflection of this step here.
Name of program, class, method, function:	PopularMoviesDemo Android App		
Determine type(s) data to be input:	none	Pick a reflection from the above drop-down.	
Determine type(s) of data to be output:	String (Hello World!)		
			
STEP THREE:	Write the purpose statement for the program (class, method, or function) indicating the exact input, the exact output, and details about the procedure used to solve to get the output	Easy (A piece of cake)	What caused you to feel the reflection you just selected? Enter details of your reflection of this step here.
Write your purpose statement.  Include this as a comment in your code.	"The purpose of this challenge is to create a simple Android App using Android Studio which will 
display ""Hello World!"" in the activity screen. 
It should be shared using GitHub with the design recipe present in the README.md file of the repository."	Pick a reflection from the above drop-down.	
			
STEP FOUR:	Think of and document your assumptions for this program, class, method, or function.	Easy (A piece of cake)	What caused you to feel the reflection you just selected? Enter details of your reflection of this step here.
Document your assumptions. Included these as a comment in your code.	Hello World! will be displayed in the app screen.	Pick a reflection from the above drop-down.	
			
STEP FIVE:	Describe, list, draw, or write exactly how you envision the final program to look when it is successfully run.  Include instructions, each prompt, user response, and output, as if your program was run below.	Easy (A piece of cake)	What caused you to feel the reflection you just selected? Enter details of your reflection of this step here.
	I envision the app to run and look exactly as the example shown on the coding challenge page.	Pick a reflection from the above drop-down.	
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
STEP SIX:	Think of and document at least 3 examples of input and corresponding output when run successfully.  	Easy (A piece of cake)	What caused you to feel the reflection you just selected? Enter details of your reflection of this step here.
	Hello World!	Pick a reflection from the above drop-down.	
	Hello World!		
	Hello World!		
			
STEP SEVEN	Make note of what changes from example to example and use these data to determine which are variables and which meaning variable names you'd like to use for them. Remember to use the camelcase naming convention.	Easy (A piece of cake)	What caused you to feel the reflection you just selected? Enter details of your reflection of this step here.
	android:text="Hello World!"	Pick a reflection from the above drop-down.	
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
STEP EIGHT:	List the steps your program should perform, one at a time, in order from start to finish for a successful solution.  You can use the variable names just created in STEP SEVEN.	Easy (A piece of cake)	What caused you to feel the reflection you just selected? Enter details of your reflection of this step here.
	Create a new android app	Pick a reflection from the above drop-down.	
	Name it PopularMoviesDemo		
	Add a TextView put Hello World! inside it.		
	Run on emulator to test		
	Screenshot emulator		
	Complete design recipe		
	Upload to github		
	share to Dr. Hatley		
			
			
			
			
STEP NINE:	Going line by line, describe how each step above will be implemented using programming constructs (e.g. if-then, loops, etc.).  This is your pseudo-code.	Easy (A piece of cake)	What caused you to feel the reflection you just selected? Enter details of your reflection of this step here.
	N/A		
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
*STEP TEN:	Highlight (underline, circle, bold) the actions (action words / verbs) in your pseudo code.		What caused you to feel the reflection you just selected? Enter details of your reflection of this step here.
	N/A	Pick a reflection from the above drop-down.	
			
*STEP ELEVEN:	Create METHODS/FUNCTIONS using your action words as method names using the PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH (build methods progressively starting with simply using title sentences in each method. Then build out the complexity of each, one at a time.)		What caused you to feel the reflection you just selected? Enter details of your reflection of this step here.
	N/A	Pick a reflection from the above drop-down.	
			
STEP TWELVE:	Translate your pseudocode (description of each step) into code, line by line, using your desired language.		What caused you to feel the reflection you just selected? Enter details of your reflection of this step here.
	N/A everything is precoded.	Pick a reflection from the above drop-down.	
			
			
			
			
STEP THIRTEEN:	Insert your steps and pseudo code from STEPS EIGHT & NINE as comments (e.g. When programming in Java, use documentation comments <before classes and methods>, multi-line comments, and single-line comments).  Think of this as tagging your code.	Easy (A piece of cake)	What caused you to feel the reflection you just selected? Enter details of your reflection of this step here.
	Add all comments from your pseudocode into your code	Pick a reflection from the above drop-down.	
			
STEP FOURTEEN:	Test and debug your code using the examples you created in STEP SIX.  Use them to design your Unit Tests, if you have reached this concept in your programming course.		What caused you to feel the reflection you just selected? Enter details of your reflection of this step here.
		Pick a reflection from the above drop-down.	
			
STEP FOURTEEN:	Document each and every test result and submit these along with your code.	Easy (A piece of cake)	What caused you to feel the reflection you just selected? Enter details of your reflection of this step here.
	Screenshots shown in README.md	Pick a reflection from the above drop-down.
